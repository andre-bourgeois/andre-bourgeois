👨‍💻 I'm a software developer working professionally as a digital consultant; advising on the development and implementation of smart spaces, buildings, and cities throughout the United Kingdom and the Middle East.

👨‍🎓 I'm also a part-time Master's student studying Connected Environments - learning how to design, build, and implement Internet of Things (IoT) networks.

I have a passion for solving problems with novel solutions that incorporate IoT, mobile and web applications, Tiny ML, and Extended Reality. In particular, I'm increasingly interested in the relationship between or physical and digital worlds, and the blurred lines that exist there.

I'm currently exploring embedded machine learning with Python and Tensorflow by building a computer vision model that can detect the level of occupancy in public bicycle stands as well as furthering my knowledge of web development by learning ReactJS over at FreeCodeCamp with this [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/free-react-course-2022/)

You can check out these things and more over at my [personal website](https://andrebourgeois.me)!
