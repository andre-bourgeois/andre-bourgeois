👨‍💻 I'm a software developer working professionally as a digital consultant; advising on the development and implementation of smart spaces, buildings, and cities throughout the United Kingdom and the Middle East.

👨‍🎓 I'm also a part-time Master's student studying Connected Environments - learning how to design, build, and implement Internet of Things (IoT) networks.

I have a passion for solving problems with novel solutions that incorporate IoT, mobile and web applications, Tiny ML, and Extended Reality. In particular, I'm increasingly interested in the relationship between or physical and digital worlds, and the blurred lines that exist there.

I'm currently using Python to explore embedded machine learning, and furthering my knowledge of web and mobile applications through a personal study of ReactJS and Node.js while leveraging this knowledge to continue imptoving my [personal website](https://andrebourgeois.me)!

Feel free to drop me a line about any of the above, always keen on an interesting conversation!
